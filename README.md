# IoT Data Pipeline - Advanced Computer Programming Final Project

## Project Overview
This project implements a complete end-to-end IoT data pipeline for sensor data processing, machine learning, and deployment. The pipeline includes data acquisition, preprocessing, model training, ONNX export, inference, and evaluation.

## Features
- **Data Acquisition**: Generate synthetic sensor data and download real datasets
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, outliers, and create features
- **Model Training**: Multiple ML algorithms with hyperparameter tuning
- **ONNX Export**: Convert models to ONNX format for cross-platform deployment
- **Model Inference**: Make predictions using both sklearn and ONNX models
- **Evaluation**: Comprehensive metrics and visualization
- **Modular Design**: Clean, maintainable code structure
